=Introduction=

This script can be used to crack WEP.

=prerequisite=

* You need Python 3 or greater.
* You need Aircrack-ng (http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=Main).
* You also need a good WIFI adapter. That is: an adapter that supports packet injection (http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=install_drivers).
* You need to install the Python package "csvsimple" (https://github.com/denis-beurive/csvsimple).

This script *should* be used under the following graphical environment : Lxde (http://lxde.org/).
But you can also run it without any graphical environment.

Note that you can adapt the script in order to use another graphical environment (othe that "Lxde").
Just edit the file "bin/wep.py", and change the function "launchTerminal(...)". You should adapt the following line:

  command = ['lxterminal', '--working-directory=%s' % WORKING_DIR, '-e', " ".join(in_command)]
